Simple form-validation practice project built as part of the OTP series : JavaScript in the Real World.

The point of this project is showcasing the use of the Constrain Validation API , so all the validations occurs in the JavaScript file. The JS code checks validaiton as the user progresses through the form and displays errors in validity when the user leaves a field.
